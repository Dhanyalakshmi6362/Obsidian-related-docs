GitHub supports Mermaid, allowing us to push the code to a GitHub repository where it will automatically be rendered as a diagram. To update the diagram, simply pull the repository, make the necessary modifications to the code, and push the changes back.

**Example Syntax:**

	```mermaid
		flowchart LR
			A-- "test" -->B
	```
