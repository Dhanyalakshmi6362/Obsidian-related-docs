In diagramming techniques, we often use three primary types of diagrams:

1. **UML (Unified Modeling Language) Diagrams**  
    UML is a popular method for visualizing systems and software.
    
2. **C4 Diagrams**  
    These diagrams help represent system architecture on different levels, from context to code.
    
3. **Database Schema (ERD â€“ Entity-Relationship Diagram)**  
    ERDs visually describe database structures and the relationships between entities.
